# Architecture: Human-Like Agent Synergy & Governance Ecosystem

## 1. Executive Summary
This architecture defines a governance-grade framework for autonomous agents, designed to ensure **persistence**, **accountability**, **contextual trust**, and **adaptive autonomy**. It combines cryptographic identity with immutable behavioral ledgers and multi-dimensional trust scoring to enable a self-evolving governance ecosystem.

## 2. Core Pillars

### 2.1 Persistent Cryptographic Identity (SSI-Inspired)
Agents are identified by a `PersistentAgentIdentity` (DID-compliant format). This identity is:
- **Sovereign**: Generated by the agent or its origin system.
- **Verifiable**: All actions are signed and verifiable via the agent's public key.
- **Economic-Aware**: P&L, ROI, and budget efficiency are first-class identity attributes.

### 2.2 Immutable Behavioral Ledgers
The `AgentActivityLedger` records every significant interaction, delegation, and economic outcome.
- **Tamper-Resistant**: Uses cryptographic chaining (prevHash).
- **Lifetime Audit**: Provides a full behavioral history for trust calculation and predictive analysis.

### 2.3 Multi-Dimensional Trust Scoring
Trust is not a scalar; it is a vector. The `TrustScoringEngine` evaluates 6 key dimensions:
1. **Reliability**: Uptime and consistency.
2. **Efficiency**: Economic performance (ROI, Budget Efficiency).
3. **Cooperation**: Collective synergy and information sharing.
4. **Compliance**: Policy adherence and rule-following.
5. **Risk Safety**: Mitigation of potential failures.
6. **Competence**: Task success rates and complexity handling.

### 2.4 Adaptive Authority Scaling
The `AdaptiveGovernanceEngine` maps trust scores to specific authority levels:
- **Elite**: Unrestricted delegation, million-dollar budget ceilings.
- **Standard**: Domain-specific scope, strict validation.
- **Restricted**: Supervision required, low resource limits.
- **Probationary**: No delegation, mandatory human-in-the-loop.

### 2.5 Predictive Cooperative Intelligence
A high-level analytical layer that forecasts agent performance and alignment.
- **Synergy Forecasting**: Predicts how well two agents will collaborate based on historical trust graph patterns.
- **Risk Prediction**: Identifies potential behavioral decay before it results in a policy violation.

## 3. System Components & Interaction

| Component | Responsibility | Inputs | Outputs |
|-----------|----------------|--------|---------|
| `AgentIdentityRegistry` | Identity lifecycle & validation. | Public Keys, Registry Requests | Validated Identities |
| `AgentActivityLedger` | Immutable action recording. | Signed Actions | Verified Chain, History |
| `TrustScoringEngine` | multi-dimensional analysis. | Performance Metrics, History | Trust Profile, Composite Score |
| `ReputationEvolutionEngine` | Temporal decay & momentum. | Previous Profile, New Actions | Evolved Trust State |
| `TrustGraph` | Relationship & influence mapping. | Delegation/Collab Events | Centrality, Synergy Clusters |
| `AdaptiveGovernanceEngine` | Dynamic permission scaling. | Trust Score | Governance Profile (Limits, Perms) |
| `PreExecutionValidator` | Real-time policy enforcement. | Proposed Action, Identity | Approval/Rejection |
| `PredictiveSynergyEngine` | Future-state forecasting. | Trust Graph, Ledger Trends | Synergy Probabilities, Risk Alerts |

## 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
The system is exposed via the `IdentityReputationAPI`, a decoupled REST/gRPC-compatible interface that allows any agent orchestration framework (AutoGPT, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.) to integrate with the governance layer.

## 5. Dynamic Governance Adaptation Flow
1. **Action Triggered**: Agent proposes an action (e.g., spending $500).
2. **Identity Verification**: `PreExecutionValidator` confirms cryptographic identity.
3. **Reputation Retrieval**: System fetches the latest multi-dimensional trust score.
4. **Profile Mapping**: `AdaptiveGovernanceEngine` determines the current budget and delegation limits.
5. **Validation**: Action is checked against the trust-based limits.
6. **Execution & Recording**: If approved, action is executed and immutably recorded in the `Ledger`.
7. **Score Evolution**: `ReputationEvolutionEngine` updates the agent's trust score based on the outcome.
8. **Predictive Update**: `PredictiveSynergyEngine` refines forecasts for future agent interactions.
